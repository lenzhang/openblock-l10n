## About OpenBlock-l10n

Translation of all OpenBlock projects is managed on the Transifex service: https://www.transifex.com/openblockcc/public/

This repository collects translations submitted to the OpenBlock projects on Transifex. **Please do not submit PRs. If you would like to contribute translations, please sign up to translate on Transifex.**

## Using OpenBlock-l10n in development

#### Installation
```bash
npm install --save-dev openblock-l10n
```

#### Basic Use
```js
import locales, {localeData, isRtl} from 'openblock-l10n';
import editorMessages from 'openblock-l10n/locales/editor-messages';
```
* `locales`: currently supported locales for the OpenBlock project
* `isRtl`: function that returns true if the locale is one that is written right-to-left
* `localeData`: locale data for the supported locales, in the format accepted by `addLocaleData` required by `react-intl`
* `editorMessages`: the actual message strings for all supported locales for a particular resource. `editorMessages` collects all the strings for the interface, extensions and paint-editor.

#### Useful Scripts
openblock-l10n provides:
* `build-i18n-src`: script that uses babel and plugins to extract all `FormattedMessage` strings for translation. Combines the message from all the source files into one `en.json`
* `tx-push-src`: script to push the `en.json` file to Transifex. Requires that the environment variable `TX_TOKEN` is set with a value that has developer access to the OpenBlock projects on Transifex (i.e. OpenBlock Team only)

#### Versioning
openblock-l10n uses semantic versioning - breaking changes will increment the major version number, and new features (e.g. a new language) will increment the minor version number. However, the patch number is actually a datetime string. That way it's easy to see how recently the translations were updated.

In general, changes that require a PR (new functionality, new language) should increment the minor version. Pulling new translations from Transifex is automated and will commit to master directly.
